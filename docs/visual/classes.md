## Test Tune

Paste in any ABC you want here and see how that affects the classes below:

<example-tune-book :callbacks="callbacks" :tune-id="32"></example-tune-book>

<script>
	export default {
		mounted() {
			setTimeout(() => {
				this.callbacks = [this.$refs.foundClasses];
			}, 500);
		},
		data() {
			return {
				callbacks: [],
			};
		},
	}
</script>

## Found Classes

Select the following classes to see what they point to. (They are ANDed together.)

<found-classes ref="foundClasses" target="#paper"></found-classes>

## CSS Possibilities

### changing colors

If you want to just change everything to one other color, you can do something like:
```
<style>
    svg {
        fill: pink;
        stroke: pink;
    }
<style>
```
If you want more control, you can use the classes. For instance, to turn only the horizontal staff lines pink, do this instead:
```
<style>
    svg .abcjs-staff {
        fill: pink;
        stroke: pink;
    }
<style>
```
